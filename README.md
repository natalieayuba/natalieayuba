# Bonjourno, fellow coders! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I’m Natalie Ayuba, a graduate software developer currently working in full-stack developement at <a href="https://www.cortex-ia.com/" target="_blank">Cortex IA</a>. Though I work in full-stack, front-end development and UI/UX design are where my heart lies, which I love to engage in both in and outside of work.

Feel free to contact me at natalieayuba@hotmail.com or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-ayuba/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> :)
